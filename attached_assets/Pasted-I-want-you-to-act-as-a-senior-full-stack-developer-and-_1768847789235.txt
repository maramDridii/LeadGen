I want you to act as a senior full-stack developer and build a complete, production-ready, human-quality project.
The project is a Twitter (X) lead generation system with automation and analytics.
Use React.js for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, PostgreSQL as the database, and LangChain + LLM for AI logic.
Use Twitter API to fetch tweets and monitor authority accounts.
Follow clean, modular, maintainable code practices.

Project requirements:

1. Backend (FastAPI)

Use FastAPI with modular routers.

PostgreSQL database with SQLAlchemy ORM.

Users table and Leads table.

Endpoints:

/monitor-tweets → Monitor tweets from authority accounts, score relevance to offer, return high-engagement tweets.

/generate-content → Analyze top-performing tweets weekly, extract patterns (hook, length, topic, format), generate 3–5 new tweet ideas per niche.

/leads → Store contacted leads, replies, CTR, conversions.

Integrate LangChain with an LLM API (like OpenAI) to analyze tweets and generate content.

Load environment variables from .env.

2. Frontend (React.js)

React dashboard with:

Leads contacted

Replies received

Click-through rate

Conversions

Axios for API calls.

Modular components: Navbar, LeadsTable, ContentGenerator, TweetMonitor.

Real-time or refreshable stats.

3. Twitter Integration

Use Twitter API to fetch tweets from authority accounts.

Filter tweets by relevance to a defined offer.

Calculate engagement score (likes + retweets + replies).

4. LangChain / AI Logic

Analyze top tweets weekly.

Extract patterns: hook style, tweet length, topic, format.

Generate 3–5 new tweet ideas optimized for the target niche.

5. Database (PostgreSQL)

Users table: id, name, email, role.

Leads table: id, username, tweet_id, contact_status, replies, CTR, conversions.

7. Extra Requirements

CORS properly configured.

Clear, modular code with comments.

Scalability in mind (future multi-agent setup).

Include README with setup instructions.

Make it look as if a human developer wrote it, not autogenerated messy code.

Deliverables

Full backend with FastAPI endpoints.

Full React frontend dashboard.

Database schema and SQLAlchemy models.

LangChain integration scripts.

Example .env file.

Instructions to run frontend (npm run dev) and backend (uvicorn app.main:app --reload).
